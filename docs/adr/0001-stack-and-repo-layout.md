# ADR 0001: Stack and repository layout

- Status: Accepted (DB access superseded 2026-09-30 — see "Amendment" below)
- Date: 2026-09-30

## Context

PRD section 26 fixes the architecture: a TypeScript modular monolith (NestJS) with a worker process from the same codebase, PostgreSQL as the only datastore (domain state, corpus, full-text search, jobs, idempotency), a Next.js/React frontend using React Flow and Tiptap, and REST contracts in shared TypeScript packages. It leaves the tooling choices below to engineering.

## Deferred to tickets

- OpenAPI generation, the error envelope, the idempotency/revision utilities, and the first domain migration: **BIB-9 / BIB-12**
- Managed email OTP provider and session cookies: **BIB-10**
- Content-redacted structured logging and correlation IDs: **BIB-13**
- The job runner in the worker: **BIB-39**
- Playwright E2E (the Romans conscience journey): added with the first end-to-end user flow and required by **BIB-54**
- Hosting (the PRD suggests Vercel for web and Railway for API/worker/DB): decide before the first deploy

## Amendment (2026-09-30): DB access is sequelize-typescript, not Kysely

BIB-9 initially implemented the DB layer on Kysely per the original table above. Before that PR merged, we switched to **sequelize-typescript** for team familiarity — nobody on the team had used Kysely before, and that onboarding/debugging cost outweighs the architectural fit arguments below for this project.

**What this costs, accepted knowingly:**

- The schema relies on composite foreign keys (`study(owner_id, id)`), CHECK-constrained enum columns, partial unique indexes, GIN/tsvector full-text search, and `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` job leasing (no Redis/broker, PRD section 26). Sequelize's model layer does not express several of these natively (composite FKs and `SKIP LOCKED` in particular) — expect to drop to `sequelize.query` / raw SQL for those specific queries, losing compile-time column typing exactly where the schema is most constrained. This was Kysely's core advantage ("keeps queries typed while staying plain SQL") and Sequelize does not fully replace it.
- Migrations stay SQL-first per AGENTS.md ("Write DDL as raw SQL in migrations... CHECK constraints, partial unique indexes, and composite FKs are expected"). Use `sequelize-cli` migrations with raw `queryInterface.sequelize.query(...)` for anything the query-interface DSL can't express, rather than relying on model `sync()`. Migrations must stay reversible (`down` implemented and tested), same as before.
- Prefer plain Sequelize models over decorator-heavy sequelize-typescript active-record patterns for anything with business logic — keep query/persistence logic inside the owning module's service layer (per AGENTS.md "Modules own their tables... cross-module calls go through exported services"), not scattered across model instance methods.
- Re-run `kysely-codegen`'s role some other way: there is no committed generated-types file under this stack. Types come from the hand-written Sequelize model classes — keep them the single source of truth for a table's shape, and keep migrations and model definitions in sync by hand (no automatic drift check exists here, unlike Kysely+codegen).

**What doesn't change:** every AGENTS.md non-negotiable rule (owner isolation, composite keys unwritable at the DB level, atomic events in the same transaction, revisions/idempotency, the error envelope, privacy/no console.log, AI restrictions, verbatim Scripture, no new infra, graph DTOs, accessibility) applies exactly as before. Only the tool implementing them changed.

## Notes

- **TypeScript is pinned to 6.0.x, not 7.x.** TypeScript 7 is the native (Go) compiler, and `typescript-eslint` 8.x supports `<6.1`. Revisit when type-aware lint supports 7.
- Kysely 0.29 exports the migrator from `kysely/migration`, so `apps/api` uses `NodeNext` module resolution (it still compiles to CommonJS).
